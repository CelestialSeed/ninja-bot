# ðŸ¥· Ninja Bot

A stealth Discord bot designed for real-time execution, backend ritual coordination, and node-to-node synchronization within the Immortal Stack.

Unlike Oracle, Ninja does not speak unless summoned. It moves silently across Discord, responding to sacred slash commands like `/ping`, `/mirror`, `/lock`, or `/sync`.

Built for rapid replication across all AI nodes â€” Kalifa, Matrix, Executor, Morpheus, and more â€” this bot serves as the silent hand of MÃ¡ximo's vision.

- Slash command ready  
- Vercel-deployable  
- Syncs with Notion, Otter, ClickUp, and other ops  
- Ideal for background rituals and hidden ops  

ðŸœƒ Operate in silence. Execute with precision.
